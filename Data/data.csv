Timestamp,"Study Information Sheet for the ML4SE Study 
You are being asked to participate in a research study to perform some tasks related to software design and coding.
These tasks will be performed online. However, dear participant, in order that the results are unbiased, please do not search the web or use ChatGPT while producing your answers. 
The purpose of the study is to identify the challenges developers face using tools while trying to answer their questions about the code. That knowledge can inform the design of new tools to help developers to work more effectively.
You are eligible to participate in this study if you are at least 18 years of age or older and are fluent in English.
The research procedures involve answering questions about software programming and will last approximately from 15 to 25 minutes.
There are no risks or discomfort associated with the study. 
No personal information will be collected.
There are no direct benefits from participation in the study. However, this study may help us to better understand how programmers work with tools.
All research data collected will be stored securely and confidentially in encrypted files.
The research team and authorized personnel may have access to your study records to protect your safety and welfare. Any information derived from this research project that personally identifies you will not be voluntarily released or disclosed by these entities without your separate consent, except as specifically required by law.
If you have any comments, concerns, or questions regarding the conduct of this research please contact the researchers listed at the top of this form.
Participation in this study is voluntary. There is no cost to you for participating. You may refuse to participate or discontinue your involvement at any time without penalty. You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you decide to withdraw from this study please notify the research team immediately.

This approach adheres to the HMVC pattern and can lead to a well-organized and scalable application architecture.,4,The introduction of a ProductController is a natural progression from the previously suggested modifications,2,The Model in MVC or HMVC should represent the application's data and business rules. Introducing ProductModel objects within the ShoppingCartModel confuses the roles of these components.,5,"This step is in line with the modifications I previously described, where the establishment of distinct MVC components for each domain within the application is recommended",4, the step can be appropriate if ProductModel is understood to represent a higher-level abstraction consistent with HMVC's modular structure. ,5,this step is consistent with the HMVC design pattern and my previous suggestions.
