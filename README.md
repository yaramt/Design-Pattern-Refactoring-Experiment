# Design-Pattern-Refactoring-Experiment
This experiment was conducted for the ML4SE course to explore the utilization of Large Language Models as assistant tools for aiding Software Engineers in code refactoring from one design pattern to another. The study involved computer scientists with varying levels of experience, who were tasked with two assignments:

Task 1: Independently refactor a patternless e-commerce application into a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure using only the provided cheat sheet on the MVC design pattern.

Task 2: Independently refactor the application, already in MVC format, into a Hierarchical Model-View-Controller (HMVC) format using the provided HMVC cheat sheet.

Following this, participants were provided with instructions from ChatGPT on how to accomplish the same tasks. They were then asked to provide feedback on the helpfulness of these instructions.
